The Canadian banking system continues to rank at the top of the world thanks to our strong quality control practices that was capable of withstanding the Great Recession in 2008. One approach to improve quality control practices is by analyzing a Bank’s business portfolio for each individual business line. Each business line require rationales on why each deal was completed and how it fits the bank’s risk appetite and pricing level. I will be attempting to create a “Quality Control System” that extracts the information from the Bank’s decision making rationales, in order to determine if the decisions that were made are in accordance to the Bank’s standards.

The dataset I will be using is directly from a Canadian Bank, and I will not be able to share this dataset. For privacy protection, I will not showcase any relevant information from the actual dataset. Any information shown here will not violate the privacy of the Bank.

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Gensim, NLTK and Spacy.

This project allowed me to dive into real world data once again and apply it in a business context once more, but this time using **Unsupervised Learning**. I will continue to look for more innovative ways to improve a Financial Institution’s decision making by using Big Data and Machine Learning.
